WebGL Introduction

Plan for the presentation:

Show a three.js WebGL app.
     - something with decently fancy fx

Show how to build a WebGL app using three.js.
     - explain the process outline
     
Start off by setting up the scene, then add child nodes and animate them.
     - scene setup (clear color, dom append)
     - add static node (load blender model)
     - add light
     - make node spin
     - add mouse-driven turntable

Create a custom vertex shader to warp the scene.
     - add sine wavey noise to model x,z-coords

Create a custom fragment shader to warp the colors.
     - invert colors
     - fudge with the light source 

Create a custom thingy to warp your mind.
